# Project 1: Major League Baseball

The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball in North America, contested
since 1903 between the American League champion team and the National League champion team. A
mountain of statistics is gathered for each Major League Baseball (MLB) game, player, player position, and
team. In this project you will write a program that executes a sequence of commands that operate on MLB
game statistics over a number of years.

The format of the input data is as follows:<br>
• The number of years y (integer) of team game statistics in this data set. <br>
• For year y the following is provided:<br>
    <pre>The total number of teams t in MLB for year y.
    For each of the t teams the following statistics are provided in a tab separated list</pre>
    
<p>∗ The team name (string),<br>
∗ the league, either American League (AL) or National League (NL) (string),<br>
∗ the number of games in which a player has appeared (integer),<br>
∗ the number of official at bats by a batter (integer),<br>
∗ the number of runs,<br>
∗ the number of times a batter hits the ball and reaches bases safely,<br>
∗ the number of times a batter hits the ball and reaches second base,<br>
∗ the number of times a batter hits the ball and reaches third base,<br>
∗ the number of home runs,<br>
∗ the number of runs that score safely,<br>
∗ the number of walks by a batter (four balls during an at bat),<br>
∗ the number of strikeouts by a batter,<br>
∗ the number of times a player has stolen a base,<br>
∗ the number of times a player has been put out attempting to steal a base,<br>
∗ the average number of hits by a batter defined by hits divided by at bats,<br>
∗ the on base percentage,<br>
∗ the slugging percentage, and<br>
∗ the on base percentage plus slugging</p><br>
